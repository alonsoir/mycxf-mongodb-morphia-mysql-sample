The idea behind of this project is to provide a clean implementation for a secured web service connected using REST architecture style with 
command pattern and composite command pattern, to a mongodb instance and a mysql instance too, best of both worlds.

The way to connect to a mongodb instance is using morphia or spring-data, both of them. There are differente examples using it.  

https://github.com/mongodb/morphia

http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-mongodb/

first steps:
check pom.xml file, there are some config data in order to configure the mysql instance, by default, the jpa database name is sample_cxf, the user 
is root/root, the ip conection is localhost (127.0.0.1)
create a database in mysql with the name of the database you choose and let to the root user the neccesary permits in order to create tables, fields,
and so on.
Necesary data for mongodb instace is located in db.properties, as well as jpa config.

mvn clean package jetty:run in order to execute it and go to localhost:9090/services

PD

What do i must know about REST?

If you want to create a non existent resource, you must use always POST, as i do in the example,if instead, you need to update something, you must always to use PUT,
if you need to delete something, DELETE is the command and, finally, if you need to read the state, you must use GET.

the job is not finished!
